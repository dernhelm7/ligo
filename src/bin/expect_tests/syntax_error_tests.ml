          Ill-formed declaration.
          At this point, if the attributes (if any) are complete, one of the
          following is expected:
            * the keyword 'const' if defining a constant;
            * the keyword 'function' if defining a function;
            * the keywords 'recursive function' if defining a recursive
              function.

  run_ligo_bad [ "compile-contract" ; "../../test/contracts/negative/error_function_arguments.religo" ; "main" ] ;
  [%expect {|
    ligo: error
          in file "error_function_arguments.religo", line 1, characters 14-27
          It looks like you are defining a function, however we do not
          understand the parameters declaration.
          Examples of valid functions:
          let x = (a: string, b: int) : int => 3;
          let tuple = ((a, b): (int, int)) => a + b;
          let x = (a: string) : string => "Hello, " ++ a;
