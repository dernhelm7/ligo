##

Ill-formed record pattern.
At this point, if the pattern of field assignment is complete, one of
the following is expected:
  * a semicolon ';' followed by another pattern of field assignment;
  * a keyword 'end' if the record pattern is complete.

Ill-formed typed pattern.
At this point, if the type annotation is complete, a closing
parenthesis ')' is expected.
